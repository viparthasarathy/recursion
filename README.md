# Recursion

Fibbonaci Sequence methods plus a merge sort method solved via recursion for [The Odin Project.](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/recursion?ref=lnav)

###Fibbonaci
`#fibs` takes a number as a parameter and returns the Fibonnaci sequence up to said number.
`#fibs_rec` takes a number as a parameter and returns the Fibonnaci value of said number.

###Merge Sort
`#merge_sort` takes an array and and returns it after being sorted through a merge sort algorithim.
